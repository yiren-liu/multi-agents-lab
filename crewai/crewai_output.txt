### 8. Evidence-Based Cost-Saving Tips

- Book flights and accommodations early to secure best prices, especially for Jan winter travel.  
- Choose Icelandair direct flights to save time, even if slightly more expensive than connecting flights.  
- Use Reykjavík Downtown Hostel or guesthouses with kitchenettes to prepare simple meals to save on food costs.  
- Opt for Flybus airport shuttle instead of taxis to reduce transfer expenses.  
- Rent a 4x4 from reliable Iceland rental companies; sharing costs with travel companions cuts expenses.  
- Use self-guided tours and free natural sites (Thingvellir, Geysir, Gullfoss) rather than expensive private tours.  
- Book Blue Lagoon entrance well in advance to get standard prices; avoid premium packages if tight on budget.  
- Visit museums on days with free or discounted admissions if available.  
- Purchase SIM card instead of roaming, use apps for maps and aurora forecast to avoid guide fees.  
- Check weather and plan efficiently as January daylight is about 5-6 hours, minimizing wasted travel time.
